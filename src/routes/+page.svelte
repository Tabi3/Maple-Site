			Maple is a personal website created by me [Taf√≠] and is basically just a simple website
			redesign for the following sites...

			<li>PSHS Knowledge Hub</li>
			<li>Wolfram Alpha</li>

	<Textbox header="Why did I create This website?." styled="false">
		<p>
			I find the UI of some websites bad, therefore I decided to make a website that scrapes
			information from said websites and makes it look better. Examples are listed down below but in
			other words, i made it to make websites to fit my preference.
		</p>
	</Textbox>
	<Textbox header="PSHS Knowledge Hub" icon="bxs-graduation" styled="false">
		<p>
			This website is a Moodle website that contains most if not all information our school provides
			for one school year at a time. The UI is user friendly nowadays, however I am not a fan that
			the UI is very laggy and buggy.

	<Textbox header="Wolfram Alpha" icon="bxs-calculator" styled="false">
		<p>
			This website is basically a calculator website. FYI I do not have premium access so i can't
			show the solutions when solving equations. The reason I redesigned this is so that I can test
			my webscraping capabilities that no joke, works like a charm.
